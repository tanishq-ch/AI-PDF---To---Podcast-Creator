Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live, work, and interact with technology. It refers to machines or computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI is used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. From voice assistants like Siri to recommendation systems on Netflix, AI is already part of our daily lives. As it continues to evolve, AI has the potential to solve complex global challenges, but it also raises ethical concerns about privacy, job loss, and fairness. Responsible development is key to its future success.
